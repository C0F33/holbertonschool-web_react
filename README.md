This repo contains work with typescript.
To my understanding type script interprets javascript code but makes it accessible to specify data types instead of being assumed by the interpreter.

Using Npm has been a trip specifically cause of the config files that holberton provides
In this isntance i had a lot of trouble getting npm webpack and other libraries installed with the right versions and editting code with ai is a nightmare because the sintax provided wont be up to the standards to some of the config files. Definitely a bit tedious, powerful though.
